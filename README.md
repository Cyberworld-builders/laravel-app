# laravel-app
This repo is for learning how to write a laravel app and get familiar with gitflow as well.

## Before you get started
- branch off of master
- name the new branch after yourself
- when you're done, this master branch should always just be this readme
- don't be afraid of fucking up, that's what this repo is here for

## Things to keep in mind
- treat your branch as if it's your own repo. 
- branch off of it when you start something new
- name the feature branch yourname/yournewfeature
- when you feel like your feature is completed and you're moving on, merge it in
- create a pull request, document with as much stuff as you like. you can write a formatted description with the editor and you can even copy and paste screen shots. i highly encourage screen shots, but at least describe what you were adding to your app in the pr.
- leave all your branches for a while so people can learn from them.
- use descriptive commits, so you know what you were doing with each change.
- feel free to browse through other people's branches to see how they did things.
